Hey! I am currently a postdoc in the [Algebra Group](http://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/BAS.html) in the Department for Mathematics and Statistics at [Masaryk University](https://www.math.muni.cz/english/) in Brno, CZ. Before that I was a PhD student supervised by [Nicola Gambino](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/) at the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. I defended my thesis ["Pseudomonads, Relative Monads and Strongly Finitary Notions of Multicategory"](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/30578/) in February 2022. You can find my cv [here](Gabriele_Lobbia_CV.pdf).

## Research
My research interests are in category theory, logic and algebra. More precisely, I mainly work on monad theory and low dimensional category theory. 

### Publications 
- [On the formal theory of pseudomonads and pseudodistributive laws](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/37/2/37-02abs.html), with N. Gambino,
_Theory and Applications of Categories_, 37 (2), 2021, pp. 14-56.

### Preprints 
- [Distributive laws for relative monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12982), 
arXiv:2007.12982, 2020. 

### Work in Progress
- _Strongly Finitary Notions of Multicategory_, joint work with [J. Bourke](http://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/) (a first version can be found in the last chapter of my PhD Thesis).
- _Kan Injectivity and KZ-Monads_, joint work with [I. Di Liberti](https://diliberti.github.io/) and [L. Sousa](http://www.estgv.ipv.pt/paginaspessoais/sousa/). 

## Talks
