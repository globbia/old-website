Hey! I am currently a PhD student in the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds supervised by [Nicola Gambino](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/). 

## Research
My research interests are in category theory, logic and algebra. More precisely, I mainly work on monad theory and low dimensional category theory. 

### Publications 
- [On the formal theory of pseudomonads and pseudodistributive laws](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/37/2/37-02abs.html), with N. Gambino,
_Theory and Applications of Categories_, 37 (2), 2021, pp. 14-56.

### Preprints 
- [Distributive laws for relative monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12982), 
arXiv:2007.12982, 2020 (under review). 

## Talks
