Hey! I am currently a postdoc in the [Algebra Group](http://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/BAS.html) in the Department for Mathematics and Statistics at [Masaryk University](https://www.math.muni.cz/english/) in Brno, CZ. Before that I was a PhD student supervised by [Nicola Gambino](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/) at the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. I defended my thesis "Pseudomonads, Relative Monads and Strongly Finitary Notions of Multicategory" in February 2022. 

## Research
My research interests are in category theory, logic and algebra. More precisely, I mainly work on monad theory and low dimensional category theory. 

### Publications 
- [On the formal theory of pseudomonads and pseudodistributive laws](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/37/2/37-02abs.html), with N. Gambino,
_Theory and Applications of Categories_, 37 (2), 2021, pp. 14-56.

### Preprints 
- [Distributive laws for relative monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12982), 
arXiv:2007.12982, 2020. 

## Talks
You can find a list of some talks I have given [here](https://globbia.github.io/seminars). 

## ItaCa
I volunteer as social media manager for [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/).
